      "description":"The British band Nothing But Thieves released their first album in 2015, but already managed to open Muse, Arcade Fire and perform in Ukraine at the U-Park Festival and Atlas Weekend. Also the musicians were caught in the filming of their videos in Kiev. The clips Horror and Sorry clearly read the native horizons.\n\n With regard to the name Broken Machine album is very thoughtful and integral. The theme of a 'broken machine' is transferred to religion, politics, social and personal life. For example, I Was Just a Kid and I'm Not Made by Design are wondering about the existence of God, hinting that religion is one big fiction.\n\n Strong, multifaceted and conceptual record. This is the merit of the producer Mike Crossi (Twenty One Pilot and Arctic Monkeys), who knows his business and confirms his status, and the merit of the group itself, which seriously approached the work and avoided the well-known "syndrome of the second album." This time it did not work. In the first weeks of sales Broken Machine soared to second place in the British album chart. Obviously, you can not miss such a release.",

  "description":"The portrait of the Infanta Margarita has a great museum and historical value and gives an idea of ​​the high artistic level of the 'golden age' of Spanish painting attributed to Diego Velazquez.\n\n The portrait of the Infanta Margarita (Margarita Teresa) comes from the collection of the founders of the museum - Bogdan and Varvara Khanenko. The painting was purchased in 1912 in Berlin at an auction sale of the collection of the Hamburg collector Weber. At the auction the work fell after a long wanderings by private collections. The first documentary evidence of the painting reaches 1827, when it belonged to the Spanish artist Vicen Lopez and soon fell into the ownership of the Infanta of Spain and Portugal, Sebastian Gabriel de Bourbon. In the heirs of the Infanta, who at that time lived in France, in the town Po, the work in 1891 acquired the London antique house Collegi. However, in the following year the portrait was resold to the German consul Eduard Weber.\n\n All this time the picture was considered a portrait of another princess - Infanta Marianna Libra (1638-1683), the eldest daughter of Philip's IV first marriage. Later she became the queen of France, the wife of Louis XIV. Only in the prewar years it was found out that the portrayed girl is the youngest daughter of the king, the child of his second wife, Marianna of Austria.",

I.\n\n With the beginning of winter, everyone is waiting for Saint Nicholas, who comes with angels to us every year, bringing joy and gifts - who deserved what. However, not everyone knows that in order for Nikolai to descend from heaven, the stars show him the way to the earth. Or will Nikolai get to us if the devil's devil, having conspired with the Wolf, conceals the stars? Of course, he can, because on such a magical night even Hares can become brave (if they can be friendly), and the light of sincere hearts can shine more than the stars.",
